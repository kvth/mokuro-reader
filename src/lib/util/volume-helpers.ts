/**
 * Is this volume read through?

 * The reader can settle on the second-to-last page (a spread shows the last two at once),
 * so both of the last two pages count as finished. THE PAGE MUST BE A REAL ONE, though:
 * page 0 means nobody has opened this volume, and a volume with no page count is one
 * nothing is known about yet (a cloud share before it is downloaded). Without those two
 * guards a one-page volume read as finished on sight (`0 === 1 - 1`), and every bare cloud
 * placeholder sorted as if it had been read to the end.
 *
 * Callers pass the RAW current page — 0 when there is no progress record — not the
 * display default of 1.

/**
 * Did the reader start a NEW PASS through this volume after `sinceMs` — as
 * opposed to revisiting a bit of one they had already finished?
 *
 * The measure is how far back they went, against a reference page (the volume's
 * length, or the page they have just finished on). At or before the halfway
 * mark is a pass; anything nearer the end is a revisit.
 *
 * THE SAME QUESTION decides two things that must not disagree: whether a
 * completion gets a new date (`updateProgress`), and whether in-period reading
 * earns fractional goal credit (`partialProgressInPeriod`). When they used
 * different rules, a re-read begun past the halfway mark accrued credit while
 * it was in progress and lost all of it at the final page turn — reading more
 * pages made the goal go DOWN.
 *
 * @param pageTurns the volume's `recentPageTurns`
 * @param sinceMs epoch ms of the completion this pass would supersede
 * @param referencePage the volume's page count, or the completing page

/**
 * Is this volume finished? THE app's answer — every surface that colours, sorts, hides or
 * counts by completion must ask this, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * It is a UNION of the two things that can say so, because neither is sufficient alone:
 *
 * - THE STORED FLAG, which is what a volume the user MARKED finished has and may be all
 *   it has. "Reading history" is broader than page turns: a volume marked as finished
 *   counts as finished with no progress, no recorded time and no page turns at all. It is
 *   also the only evidence a BARE PLACEHOLDER can carry — progress synced from the device
 *   that actually read it, against a volume whose `page_count` is unknown here (0), for
 *   which the derivation below can only ever answer "no".
 * - THE DERIVATION from the raw page, which is what survives the flag being wrong. The
 *   flag is written by `updateProgress(volume, progress, chars?, completed = false)`, and
 *   callers that only mean to move the page (`Reader.toggleHasCover`, the page input in
 *   reader settings) pass two arguments — so an ordinary page change can store
 *   `completed: false` over a volume that IS read through. Deriving beats trusting.
 *
 * A `false` flag therefore never overrides a derived "yes"; it only ever fails to add one.
 * Anything that genuinely un-reads a volume (`markVolumeAsUnread`, "restart series")
 * clears the page as well as the flag, so both halves answer "no" together.
