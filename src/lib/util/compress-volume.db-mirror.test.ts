/**
 * Regression test for the worker-side Dexie mirror in `getDatabase()`
 * (compress-volume.ts). That function opens a SEPARATE connection to the
 * same `mokuro_v3` database `CatalogDexieV3` (db-v3.ts) owns, with its own
 * independently-declared version ladder — nothing enforces the two schemas
 * staying in sync mechanically.
 *
 * The failure mode this guards against (reproduced while fixing Task 2,
 * fix-round-1): if the mirror's declared version/table set falls behind
 * db-v3.ts's, Dexie's schema-diff auto-heal recreates any table the mirror
 * doesn't declare — silently wiping whatever rows were in it. This test
 * seeds `catalog_index` and `cloud_covers` through the real `CatalogDexieV3`
 * schema, drives a real worker code path (which opens the mirror internally
 * via the unexported `getDatabase()`), and asserts both tables — and their
 * rows — are still there afterward.

/**
 * The mechanical half of the same guard.
 *
 * The behavioural test above proves the worker connection does not WIPE a
 * table, but it cannot see a table whose PRIMARY KEY or index list drifted at
 * the SAME version number: neither connection complains, they simply file rows
 * under different key paths, and the damage surfaces later as reads that find
 * nothing. That divergence used to be possible because the ladder was written
 * out twice; it is not any more, because `db-schema.ts` states it once and both
 * connections apply it (`declareMokuroSchema`).
 *
 * So these two tests guard the only remaining ways back in:
 *
 * 1. a hand-written `.version(n).stores({...})` ladder reappearing next to
 *    either connection — which is what would re-create two sources of truth;
 * 2. the shared declaration itself changing a primary key or an index list,
 *    which is a database migration rather than an edit, and must not happen by
 *    accident. Asserted against a signature spelled out here independently, so
 *    editing the schema alone cannot make its own test agree with it.
 *
 * Vite reads the sources as text at transform time — no node:fs, so this runs
 * the same way under vitest as it would in any browser-target runner.
