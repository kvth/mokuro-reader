   * entry the file lacks, never overriding and never exempting; placeholders
   * never contribute at all, their uuids and counts being derived.
   *
   * A folder the listing shows no `.cbz` in is `'skipped'`: the index belongs
   * to a folder of volumes, never to an empty one. A cloud copy we cannot read
   * is `'skipped'` too rather than overwritten blind; a failed upload throws to
   * the (background) caller, which logs it — a series.json write must never
   * surface in a reading flow.
   *
   * `options.localSeriesTitle` reads the installed volumes under a DIFFERENT

   * gates the local commit, so the DB still holds the old title while the file
   * must already be written under the new one.

   * actually shows (`resolveCloudFolderTitle`), because the path IS the folder:
   * writing under the caller's spelling of a decomposed folder would create a
   * second folder next to the real one. Everything LOCAL-facing keeps the
   * caller's title, folded where it has to meet the cloud.
   *
   * The only network READ this method can make is `resolveExistingSeriesFile`'s
   * re-read, and only when the listing shows a copy our cache has not seen (see
   * its doc comment). The `cache?.isLoaded()` and `cloudVolumeTitles` gates
