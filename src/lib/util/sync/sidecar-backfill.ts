/**
 * Lazy per-volume sidecar backfill: a library uploaded before the sidecar
 * convention existed holds `.cbz` archives with their mokuro data EMBEDDED and
 * no cover files beside them, so every other device sees blank covers and the
 * cloud OCR pipeline finds nothing to read. Any volume that is INSTALLED here
 * already carries everything those sidecars would say — the OCR rows serialize
 * to exactly the `.mokuro` a backup writes, and the row's `thumbnail` is the
 * cover — so this module uploads the missing one(s), sourced from local data,
 * whenever the active provider's listing shows the volume's archive without
 * them.
 *
 * Three feeds, one check, one upload core:
 *
 * - IMPORT (`queueSidecarBackfillFromImport`, called the moment a cloud
 *   download finishes importing): the parsed pages `saveVolume` just wrote
 *   and the cover the import generated are IN MEMORY, so the missing
 *   sidecars upload right then — no Dexie re-read, no waiting for the
 *   download queue to drain, and no session cap (each upload is bounded by a
 *   download the user personally started). Skipped when the download's own
 *   provider is no longer the active one; the deferred feeds heal that later.
 * - install nomination (`queueSidecarBackfillForVolume`, the safety net right
 *   after the import feed at the same call site) enqueues that one volume for
 *   the deferred drain;
 * - listing load (`sweepInstalledVolumesForSidecarBackfill`, riding the same
 *   post-listing hook as `reconcileMissingMetadataFiles`) enqueues every
 *   installed volume the fresh listing shows a sidecar gap for.
 *
 * The deferred feeds only nominate CANDIDATES; the drain re-derives
 * "installed + archive listed + sidecar missing" per volume from the provider
 * cache at dispatch time ({@link deriveSidecarGap} — the ONE eligibility
 * check every path runs). The import feed carries its data with it but runs
 * the same check inside the same drain loop, and a volume is marked attempted
 * before its upload is dispatched — so the three feeds cannot disagree with
 * each other or with what actually gets uploaded, and no volume ever has two
 * uploads in flight whatever mix of feeds produced it. Deferred volumes
 * upload in parallel (bounded, through the worker pool — see below); the
 * import feed stays serial on the main thread.
 *
 * NON-AGGRESSIVE by construction, in this order of defenses:
 *
 * - Nothing here ever fetches a listing, and nothing here ever writes
 *   `series.json` either. The decision is made FROM a listing that just
 *   arrived (or from the provider cache it filled), and every upload ends in
 *   the same targeted cache add (`unifiedCloudManager.blindUploadFile` does
 *   it internally for the main-thread feeds; the worker feed's completion
 *   handler performs the identical `uploadCacheEntry` add) — so the next
 *   check sees the sidecar without any fetch. When
 *   the provider's upload response carried no server mtime, that cache entry
 *   is stamped with the CLIENT clock and marked `modifiedTimeProvisional`,
 *   and `cloud-sidecar-stamps.ts` refuses to derive a `series.json` stamp
 *   from a provisional entry — a server mtime that lands even a second off
 *   would make the very next listing see its own upload as stale and re-pull
 *   the sidecar it just wrote. So a reconcile pass that runs off this cache
 *   BEFORE the next real listing (the backup buttons call
 *   `reconcileMissingMetadataFiles()` with no listing argument) publishes the
 *   entry stampless — safe: a stampless entry adopts the next listing as its
 *   baseline. The stamp publishes once a REAL listing has replaced the
 *   provisional entry with the server's own `modifiedTime` — the same
 *   write-after-real-listing discipline `backup-queue.ts`'s
 *   `finishBackupRun` uses (it refetches before it writes, rather than
 *   trusting its own upload-time cache entries). That "safe" claim is about
 *   STAMPS only — the same no-listing button-triggered reconcile pass also
 *   drives `series-file-sync.ts`'s prune step (`writeSeriesFile` pruning
 *   against `cloudVolumeTitles`), which had its own hazard against a stale
 *   cache: see `ScheduleOptions.fromCloudListing` there for the fix
 *   (`fromCloudListing` now reflects whether THIS call actually got a fresh
 *   listing, not whether `runReconcile` can in general).
 * - Bounded, not greedy: the IMPORT feed stays strictly serial on the main
 *   thread (its payload is in memory and its upload rides the user's own
 *   download), while DEFERRED volumes upload through the shared worker pool —
 *   at most {@link SIDECAR_WORKER_CONCURRENCY} in flight at once, each one
 *   re-derived, dispatched, and cache-added individually. The bound is
 *   enforced HERE (the drain never has more than that many dispatches
 *   outstanding) and repeated to the pool as a `providerConcurrencyLimit`
 *   under the same `<provider>:upload` key the backup queue uses, so backfill
 *   plus backup together still respect the provider's own upload limit. A
 *   provider that cannot upload from a worker (`supportsWorkerUpload` false —
 *   the Local Folder provider's directory handle is window-bound) falls back
 *   to the old serial main-thread upload per volume.
 * - Deferred behind user-driven work: the drain waits for the download queue
 *   to be EMPTY before every DEFERRED dispatch, so a batch download the user
 *   is watching never shares its connection with a background upload — and
 *   when downloads START mid-batch, uploads already in flight finish but no
 *   new dispatch happens until the queue is idle again. Import-fed entries
 *   are exempt from the wait — their upload(s) ARE part of the download the
 *   user is watching (up to two PUTs per finished volume, and a `.mokuro`
 *   can run to a few MB), and serving them immediately is what lets their
 *   in-memory payload be released instead of pinned for the whole batch.
 * - NOT capped per session. "Non-aggressive" is the bounded dispatch plus the
 *   download-queue idle wait — pacing, not abandonment. An earlier 25/session
 *   cap was removed by the user's ruling: it halted convergence (measured:
 *   214 qualifying volumes waiting on ~9 artificial page reloads) while
 *   buying nothing the idle-deferral did not already buy. The drain runs
 *   until the queue is empty, yielding to any user-driven download before
 *   every dispatch.
 * - A volume ATTEMPTED this session — uploaded, failed, or found to have
 *   nothing uploadable — is never retried until the next page load, same
 *   session-scoped contract as `hole-patch.ts`'s `attemptedThisSession`.
 * - Read-only and server-compiled providers are skipped at the door
 *   (`hasWritableNonServerProvider`, shared with `series-backfill.ts`):
 *   nothing is enqueued, nothing is logged per volume. A server that compiles
 *   metadata from the archives it holds does not want client sidecars racing
 *   its own pipeline.
 * - A volume whose archive (or whole folder) is absent from the listing is
 *   OUT OF SCOPE, silently: uploading it is backup territory, and this module
 *   never creates folders.
 *
 * Nothing is persisted: every set here is in-memory and session-scoped, and
 * the uploads themselves carry no account identity beyond the path.

/**
 * How many DEFERRED-feed sidecar uploads may be in flight at once through the

 *
 * - one below the LOWEST provider backup-upload limit (Google Drive and

 *   queue's — so even a maxed backfill leaves the provider at least one
 *   upload slot for a backup the user starts, while a running backup makes
 *   the backfill (whose own limit trips first) yield;
 * - three parallel multi-MB PUTs saturate a typical uplink; past that the

 * This pre-filter is deliberately cheap and folded (one pass over the
