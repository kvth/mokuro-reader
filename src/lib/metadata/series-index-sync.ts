/**
 * The read half of the `series.json` index: after every cloud listing, re-read
 * the sidecars that actually changed and drop the ones whose folder is gone.
 *
 * It is a cache refresh, so it is deliberately timid:
 *
 * - Only folders that hold at least one `.cbz` count. An orphan `series.json`
 *   (a folder whose volumes were deleted, or a hand-made one) must never create
 *   a `series_metadata` record or an index for a series with no volumes — that
 *   would resurrect a deleted series in the catalog on every device.
 * - Only files whose (`size`, `modifiedTime`) differ from the cached record are
 *   downloaded, capped at 4 at a time, so a 300-series library costs one listing
 *   and zero downloads on a normal launch.
 * - Everything is best-effort: a bad file is dropped with one warning, a failed
 *   download is skipped, and the whole run never rejects. It runs behind a
 *   reading flow and must never surface there.
 * - Facts go through `upsertFromSeriesFile`, which applies only strictly newer
 *   facts and never schedules a `series.json` write — so a refresh can never
 *   ping-pong into an upload (see `series-file-sync.ts`). The shelf alignment in
 *   the file is not applied to the record at all: the cached record IS how it
 *   reaches the catalog (`getSpineOffsets` joins it at display time).
 * - A run is BOUND to the provider whose listing produced it. Between the fetch
 *   and the (background, possibly queued) run the user can switch accounts, and
 *   the listing's file ids, paths and folder set all belong to the old one:
 *   downloading or cleaning up against the new provider would be nonsense.
 * - All refreshed records are written in ONE `putSeriesIndexes`: the table feeds
 *   a liveQuery the catalog joins, so a write per folder would rebuild the
 *   placeholder set N times for a single listing.
