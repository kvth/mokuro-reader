 * The freshness half of `series-backfill.ts`: turning a cloud folder listing
 * into per-volume `.mokuro`/cover sizes-and-mtimes, and deciding from them
 * whether a `series.json` entry needs rebuilding.
 *
 * Every stamp here comes from the LISTING's own `size`/`modifiedTime` for the
 * sidecar file — never a local stat, never `Date.now()`. That is not a style
 * preference: a local clock would make two devices disagree about whether an
 * entry is stale, and the whole point of the stamp is that every reader of
 * `series.json` (including a device that never pulled anything) can compare it
 * against the SAME listing and get the same answer.
 *
 * The provider cache is ALLOWED to hold entries whose `modifiedTime` is a
 * client-clock fallback (an upload whose response carried no server mtime) —
 * but every such entry is marked `modifiedTimeProvisional`, and
 * {@link stampFromSidecarFiles} refuses to derive a stamp from one: the entry
 * gets NO stamp for that sidecar, which is safe by design ({@link isSidecarStale}
 * treats a stampless entry as adopting the next listing as its baseline). The
 * next full listing replaces the provisional entry with a server-stamped one,
 * and the stamp publishes on the pass after that.

 *   practice EVERY entry a library accumulated before this scheme existed) →

 *   stamps it via `buildCloudSidecarStamps`; a genuinely-pulled entry for
 *   the SAME series carries every other entry through unchanged); until
 *   then it stays unstamped, which costs nothing.

 *   pulls in one pass, starving the catalog's own cover fetches on the same
 *   provider connection until cards went blank. Never bring back heal-once
 *   without a rate limit that accounts for a whole-library migration.)
 * - Otherwise (the entry DOES carry a stamp): stale when the size differs,
 *   or when the listing's mtime is STRICTLY newer than the stored one.
 *   Equal-or-older mtime with an equal size is never stale — a provider
 *   whose mtimes drift backwards or repeat must not cause a re-pull loop.
