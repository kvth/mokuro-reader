/**
 * The cloud half of OCR layers: `<Volume Title>.<layer-id>.mokuro[.gz]` files
 * beside a volume's archive (the shape mokuro-bunko's engines write) mirror
 * the `volume_ocr_layers` rows of that volume on this device.
 *
 * Rides the same post-listing hook as `series-index-sync.ts`, with the same
 * temperament: decided FROM the listing in hand (never a fetch of its own),
 * bounded downloads, every failure swallowed, bound to the provider whose
 * listing it was handed.
 *
 * - Only rows that exist locally can receive a layer (installed or
 *   metadata-only volumes). A placeholder has no row and gets nothing — a
 *   layer for a volume this device never held would be dead weight, and it
 *   arrives with the volume anyway (`pullLayersForVolume` after a download).
 * - Every stamp is the LISTING's own `size`/`modifiedTime`, compared against
 *   the row's `cloud` stamp exactly as `isSidecarStale` does for `series.json`
 *   entries: a different size, or a newer mtime, means the cloud copy moved.
 *   A provisional (client-clock) mtime stamps size only.
 * - Newest wins, no merge: a row edited locally since its last sync is pushed
 *   (writable providers) unless the cloud copy is newer than the edit, in
 *   which case the cloud copy replaces it.
 * - The `.mokuro` a push writes is pure upstream format (`buildMokuroMetadata`);
 *   the layer's kind/name are inferred from the id on the other side, never
 *   embedded.
 * - A layer may be listed twice, as `.mokuro` AND `.mokuro.gz`. The plain file
 *   wins every read; a push (always the plain name) removes the `.gz` it
 *   supersedes, and a delete removes both — see `ListedLayerFile.copies`.
 * - A layer deleted here whose cloud copy could not be removed at the time
 *   leaves a pending-delete tombstone (see `PendingLayerDelete`): its file is
 *   never pulled back, and is deleted by the first listing that can.
