/**
 * The series-open load step: refresh THIS series' `series.json` (size/mtime
 * gated, not waiting for the listing-wide pass), materialize its index entries
 * as metadata-only rows, then install their covers from the per-volume sidecars.
 *
 * Deduped per normalized series key, so the view mounting, a route change and a
 * hole patch arriving together cost one pass. Best-effort throughout: never
 * rejects, never surfaces UI — a series that fails to load simply shows what the
 * device already had.
 *
 * The returned promise settles at MATERIALIZATION, not at the end of the pass,
 * and the dedupe entry is released at that same moment. That is the point the
 * catalog has its rows and the view can render, whereas cover install is one
 * network round trip per volume behind it: a caller showing a spinner would
 * hold it over I/O it is not waiting for, and — worse — a cover phase that
 * hangs would pin the series' dedupe entry, silently turning every later open
 * into a no-op. Covers are still awaited INSIDE the pass so their failures stay
 * contained here, but they are NOT part of what is deduped; owning a per-series
 * in-flight guard is `installCoversForSeries`' own job.
