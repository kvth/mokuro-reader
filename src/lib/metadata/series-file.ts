 * embedded mokuro before install). The entry then honestly reports the

 * supersedes it the moment any device imports the real archive. Display-only
 * and self-healing; do not "fix" it by sniffing archive contents here.

 * THE one merge rule for `SeriesFileVolume` entries. Every site that combines

 * write), `mergeSeriesFileForCache` (caching an import), and
 * `scheduleSeriesFileWrite`'s cloudMeasured accumulator — goes through this
 * one factory, so the identity and winner rules cannot drift between sites.
 * (They did once: every site keyed by `volume_uuid` alone, so the no-metadata
 * entry's derived uuid never matched the real mokuro's uuid for the same file
 * and the two entries DOUBLED instead of replacing.)
 *
 * IDENTITY — an incoming entry matches an existing one when EITHER key
 * matches:
 *
 * - same title key — by default the folded `volume_title`
 *   ({@link normalizeVolumeTitleKey}): the title maps to the archive
 *   FILENAME, unique per folder on every provider, so it is the reliable
 *   join. The uuid legitimately CHANGES under one title — a no-metadata
 *   entry's derived uuid is superseded by the real mokuro's, and a re-OCR
 *   mints a fresh one. `titleKeyOf` narrows the join for the one site that
 *   must be stricter: `parseSeriesFile` matches on the EXACT title string,
 *   because case-distinct filenames (`Vol 1` vs `VOL 1`) genuinely coexist
 *   on case-sensitive providers and a parse-time healer has no listing to
 *   ask — folding there would delete the entry of a file that still exists.
 *   The build sites keep the fold: they run under a listing (or a caller)
 *   that knows which files are real, and their output is pruned against it;
 * - same `volume_uuid`: the filename legitimately changes under one uuid too
 *   — a user renames the archive, and the uuid (from the mokuro inside it)
 *   rides along unchanged.
 *
 * A single incoming entry can therefore match TWO existing entries at once —
 * one by uuid (the pre-rename entry) and one by title (whatever sat on the
 * new name, typically a no-metadata placeholder). ALL matches collapse into
 * ONE winner, so the invariant — no two entries share a uuid or a title
 * key — holds on `values()` by construction, and a violated input (an
 * already-doubled published file) collapses deterministically instead of
 * throwing: this code runs against real user data.
 *
 * WINNER, decided pairwise per match:
 *
 * 1. a real entry beats a no-metadata one ({@link isMetadataLessEntry}),
 *    whichever side it arrives on — "the no-metadata entry is REPLACED when
 *    the mokuro is read", and a later no-metadata rebuild never claws back a
 *    real entry;
 * 2. an entry with measured content beats one with none — the safety net for
 *    a no-metadata entry whose derived uuid no longer recomputes (see
 *    {@link isMetadataLessEntry});
 * 3. otherwise the `mode` decides: `'replace'` keeps the incoming entry,
 *    `'fill'` keeps the held one. The schema carries no per-entry clock, so
 *    "local/installed beats published, newer beats older" is expressed by
 *    application ORDER at the call sites (existing file → pulled sidecars →
 *    metadata-only fills → installed rows), not by a timestamp.
 *
 * INHERITANCE — a collapse is field-aware, never a plain deletion: the
 * winner takes each {@link INHERITED_FILE_FACTS} field from the entry it
 * displaces, wherever the winner itself lacks the field. Those fields
 * describe the files beside the entry, not the content that decided the
 * winner, so they survive the collapse the way the archive survives a
 * re-OCR. The read path is why this lives HERE and not at the call sites:
 * `parseSeriesFile` heals a doubled published file before `buildSeriesFile`
 * ever sees it as `existing`, so a field the heal dropped would already be
 * gone by the time a write-site rescue went looking for it — the published
 * file would lose `archive_size`, the shelf `offset` and the sidecar stamps
 * for good. Losing a stamp is the expensive direction: a stampless entry is
 * never stale (`isSidecarStale`), so staleness detection for it never fires
 * again on any device, while an inherited stamp that turns out to be behind
 * the listing just triggers one self-correcting re-verify. One field is not
 * unconditionally covered by this rescue: `buildSeriesFile` applies the
 * local shelf alignment — including an explicit zero, a deliberate reset —
 * to `offset` AFTER this merge runs, so a device holding a local zero for a
 * volume can still drop the `offset` its OWN merge just inherited onto that
 * volume's entry (a stable, one-time drop this device's own build keeps
 * making, not a ping-pong with another device — see the reset's own comment
 * there).
 *
 * DEVICE-LOCAL ALTERNATION — the trade rule 3 makes. When two devices hold
 * DIFFERENT real entries for the same archive (device A still has the
 * original `vol-1-old` installed; device B re-OCR'd the same file into
 * `vol-1-new`), the pair is a pure tie — same class, same content rank — so
 * each device's installed pass wins with its OWN uuid, and the published
 * entry flips uuid whenever the other device next writes. Under the old
 * by-uuid-only merge the two coexisted as exactly the doubled index this
 * rule exists to collapse, so the flip is the accepted cost of the fix. It
 * is bounded: parse healing is deterministic on every device ('fill', first
 * entry wins), the flip requires BOTH devices to keep writing the same
 * series while holding divergent re-OCRs, and it settles the moment either
 * device re-downloads the other's upload. A device-independent tiebreak
 * (lexicographic uuid, say) was considered and REJECTED: the merger cannot
 * tell an installed-row tie (where it would converge the devices) from a
 * pulled-sidecar tie — a `cloudMeasuredVolumes` entry also collides
 * real-on-real after a re-OCR, and THERE the pulled sidecar IS the cloud's
 * current content and must win no matter how the uuids sort. Splitting
 * those apart would take a third merge mode; a transient, self-limiting
 * flip does not buy that.

 * `volume_title` — the merger's own identity rule, because "the same archive"
 * is what a material difference must be judged per. MATERIAL means:
 *
 * - COLLAPSE: two published entries land on one built entry (the doubled-index
 *   shape that survives parse healing: case-drift titles folding together
 *   under the listing);
 * - SUPERSEDE: a published no-metadata entry ({@link hasMeasuredContent}
 *   false — the 0/0 shape `buildNoMetadataEntry` mints) whose built
 *   counterpart is measured. This is the user-visible bug this predicate was
 *   built for: install the volume, the measured counts land in Dexie, the
 *   published 0/0 entry stands forever;
 * - ENRICHMENT: a built entry carries one of {@link INHERITED_FILE_FACTS}
 *   where its published counterpart has none. EXACTLY that field list, not
 *   one more: those are the fields the merger's INHERITANCE rule guarantees
 *   survive any later device's replace-mode collapse, which is what makes
 *   absent→present convergent across devices. A field outside the list
 *   (`spine_width`, deliberately uninherited) can be DROPPED by another
 *   device's installed-row win, and counting it would have two devices
 *   add-and-drop it at each other forever;
 * - LISTING-BACKED ADDITION: a built entry with no published counterpart
 *   whose folded title the cloud listing shows as an archive. Cloud-backed
 *   only, because every other device's prune KEEPS a listed entry — an
 *   addition the listing does not vouch for (a local-only install) would be
 *   pruned by the next device's ordinary write and re-added here, forever.
 *
 * Everything else is deliberately NOT material:
 *
 * - a matched pair whose `volume_uuid` differs while BOTH sides are measured.
 *   That is the device-local alternation `createVolumeEntryMerger` documents
 *   (device A holds `vol-1-old` installed, device B re-OCR'd into
 *   `vol-1-new`; each build prefers its own) — an accepted trade precisely
 *   BECAUSE nothing schedules writes off it. Counting uuid flips would have
 *   two live devices ping-pong the published file forever;
 * - value changes in fields both sides carry (counts, versions, stamp
 *   values): same alternation logic one level down, and staleness detection
 *   (`isSidecarStale`) already owns stamp movement;
 * - published entries with no built counterpart (the listing prune at work):
 *   a device holding the volume locally re-adds what a device without it
 *   removes, so removals as a trigger would alternate the same way;
 * - entry order, facts, `updated_at`, `spine_offset`, serialization: the
 *   comparison never reads them.
 *
 * CONVERGENCE, the property the whole feature hangs on: after the heal-write
 * publishes `built`, the next cycle's `published` IS this `built` (modulo a
 * wire round trip, which `stringifySeriesFile`/`parseSeriesFile` keep an
 * identity), every pair matches itself, no term fires, and no further write
 * is scheduled — one write per damaged file per device, ever. Pinned by the
 * two-cycle tests in `series-file.test.ts` / `series-backfill.test.ts`.

 *
 * - local record carries facts → newest facts clock wins, ties keep local (that

 * - local record is factless but HAS a facts clock (someone unlinked here) → the
 *   unlink is published, but only when it is strictly newer than the file;
 * - local record is factless with NO facts clock (this library never had an
 *   opinion; its `updated_at` only ever tracked per-user state) → whatever is
 *   already published is carried through untouched, and with nothing published
 *   either the file is index-only and stamped `FACTLESS_UPDATED_AT`.
 *
 * Volumes are the union of the existing index and the local rows, merged
 * through `createVolumeEntryMerger` — matched by `volume_uuid` OR folded
 * `volume_title`, since either key identifies the same archive — because a
 * device only ever knows about its own volumes, so it must not delete entries
 * written by another device. Local rows rank by how much they prove:
 *
 * - INSTALLED — measured here, archive present: overrides the published entry,
 *   and its uuid is exempt from the listing prune (a volume not backed up yet is
 *   local-only, not deleted).
 * - metadata-only (including rows materialized from an index) — a copy of
 *   somebody else's claim: FILLS an entry the file is missing, but never
 *   overrides the published one (which may describe a re-OCR this device has
 *   never seen) and never exempts it from the prune (keeping a history row is
 *   not evidence the archive still exists).
 * - placeholder — the cloud's own volumes reflected back, uuids and counts
 *   derived rather than measured: excluded entirely.
 *
 * Passing `cloudVolumeTitles` (the titles the current cloud listing shows for
 * this series) prunes entries whose volume is neither in the cloud nor installed
 * here, which is how a deleted volume eventually leaves the index.
 *
 * `cloudMeasuredVolumes` — entries the sidecar-backfill pass (`series-backfill.ts`)
 * built by pulling a volume's `.mokuro`/`.mokuro.gz` straight from the cloud
 * folder — rank ABOVE the published copy (the pulled sidecar IS the cloud's
 * current content: it self-heals a stale published entry after a re-OCR
 * upload) but BELOW an installed row, which is still measured on this device.
 * Applied by folded `volume_title`, not just uuid: a re-OCR can mint a new
 * `volume_uuid` for the same archive, so the stale published entry under the
 * OLD uuid is retired rather than left beside the fresh one under the new.
 *
 * `cloudSidecarStamps` — the current listing's `.mokuro`/cover file sizes and
 * mtimes (epoch seconds), keyed by folded volume title. When an INSTALLED row
 * builds its own entry below, this is where it picks up `mokuro_size` /
 * `mokuro_modified` / `cover_size` / `cover_modified` when the listing shows
 * that volume's sidecar right now — the freshest stat an installed row can
 * carry. Absent (or missing an entry for a title), the stamps the displaced
 * published entry already carried ride through instead, via the merger's
 * field inheritance (see `createVolumeEntryMerger`): a possibly-behind stamp
 * re-triggers staleness verification when the sidecar moves, where a
 * stripped one never would (`isSidecarStale` treats stampless as never
 * stale).
 *
