 * `materializeSeriesVolumes` skips an entry whose uuid belongs to another
 * series (rule 0) or whose title a local row already owns (rule 2), and a whole
 * batch is dropped before the transaction when `cloudVolumeTitlesFor` reports
 * an empty listing for its series — the state of every index cached from a
 * provider that is no longer the connected one, which `runRefresh`
 * deliberately never cleans. Without this set those uuids are re-planned on
 * every run — one listing lookup per series and one indexed read per batch,
 * on every sync, forever, for rows that can never be written. Not a coverage
 * cap: it only ever holds uuids the cached index has PROVED cannot become
 * rows, and it is written only after that index was consulted.
 *
 * SESSION-SCOPED, cleared only by a page load, matching the same contract
 * `hole-patch.ts` uses for its own attempt memory. The trade-off is deliberate:
 * a uuid that only becomes materializable later in the SAME session (a provider
 * switch bringing a different listing) waits for the next load rather than
 * re-entering the plan on every sweep. A uuid that gains a row by any other
 * route is not affected at all — step 2 drops it before this set is ever
 * consulted.

/**
 * Give every volume the user has actually read a `volumes` row.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Synced progress is keyed by `volume_uuid` and travels
 * without the catalog. A device that has read 726 volumes across other
 * machines — or that has had its database rebuilt — holds 726 reading records
 * and, until it happens to OPEN each of those series, no rows at all. Every
 * stats and history surface joins progress against the `volumes` table, so
 * those volumes show up with no title, no series and no counts; in
 * `reading-speed-history.ts` they collapse into a single fake
 * `[Missing Series Info]` series, and `ReadingSpeedView` then offers that
 * series' whole bucket for deletion. Real reading history is one click from
 * being tombstoned. The row is what prevents all of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It writes METADATA-ONLY rows and never a thumbnail:
 * covers are resolved per surface by cloud path through `acquireCover`
 * (`cover-resolver.ts`) out of the `cloud_covers` table, and blobs on
 * `volumes` rows are exactly the cost a whole plan just removed. It also does
 * not materialize a series wholesale the way `openSeries` does — only the
 * volumes with activity earn a row, so the table stays near the ~726 the
 * history justifies rather than ballooning to every sibling volume of every
 * series the user ever touched. The catalog scans this table whole, so row
 * count is a running cost, not a one-off.
 *
 * HOW A VOLUME IS IDENTIFIED. Purely by `volume_uuid`, resolved against the
 * cached `series.json` indexes (`series_index`). This is the answer to the
 * legacy case: `series_title` is OPTIONAL on a reading-state entry and is only
 * backfilled lazily on write, so an entry written before that existed carries
 * a uuid and nothing else — invisible forever to anything that keys off the
 * title. The uuid, though, is exactly what a `series.json` entry is keyed by,
 * and the listing-wide index refresh (`series-index-sync.ts`) caches a
 * `series.json` for EVERY folder in the account. A stored `series_title` is
 * therefore not needed at all; it survives only as a tie-breaker for the rare
 * uuid two series both claim (a re-OCR, or the same archive uploaded twice).
 *
 * THE LIMIT OF THAT. It is the CACHED INDEX that makes a legacy entry
 * reachable, not the uuid on its own — so an entry with no `series_title` whose
 * series has no cached `series.json` is served by neither this sweep (nothing
 * lists its uuid) nor `patchProgressHoles`' network phase (which pulls by name
 * and has no name to pull). That is not a regression — such an entry was
 * unreachable before too — but "legacy entries are now reachable" is true only
 * once the index refresh has cached a `series.json` for that series' folder,
 * which for an account still connected happens on its own and for a series long
 * gone from the cloud never does.
 *
 * WORST-CASE WORK. One `getAllKeys` on `volumes` (primary keys only — no row,
 * and above all no thumbnail blob, is deserialized), one `series_index` read
 * (SHARED with `patchProgressHoles`' second phase when it supplies
 * `readIndexes`, so a full sweep reads `series_index` once, not twice), one
 * in-memory pass over its entries, and — only when there is something to
 * write — ONE `volumes` readwrite transaction for the whole sweep, inside which
 * a second keys-only read (bounded by what the run planned, not by the table)
 * settles which planned uuids actually got a row. The
 * per-series `materializeSeriesVolumes` calls nest inside it, which Dexie
 * collapses into a single commit, so N series cost ONE `storagemutated`
 * broadcast and therefore ONE catalog re-derive rather than N. Zero network:
 * everything it reads is already on the device. A run with nothing to do opens
 * no write transaction at all, and a readwrite transaction that writes nothing
 * broadcasts nothing (both verified). There is no per-run cap on rows or
 * series: the set is bounded by the reading history, and one run drains it
 * (the transaction must not be split into batches to reintroduce one).
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: never rejects, never surfaces UI. Returns the number
 * of rows created or filled.
