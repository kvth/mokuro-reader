 * which until the archive is downloaded. This entry exists only to carry the

 * re-planning the archive on every listing; its zero-content shape is exactly
 * what `hasMeasuredContent` (series-file.ts) reads as "this entry proves
 * nothing", which keeps merges treating it as the weakest possible claim.
 * Consumers that copy a version onto a row or placeholder go through
 * `entryMokuroVersion`: with no cover stamps either (ALL sidecars missing)
 * this shape surfaces as `'unknown'` — never as the image-only `''` — while
 * cover stamps prove a modern backup wrote sidecars without a mokuro, which
 * IS a genuine image-only signal.

 * Used by the backfill for a whole series and by `cover-service.ts`'s
 * render-demand path (decision-tree case 4) for exactly one archive — the
