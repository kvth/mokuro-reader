/**
 * Patch the holes synced progress leaves behind, in two phases.
 *
 * `catalog.json` carries names only, so a device that has read a volume on
 * another machine can hold progress for a series it has no rows and no cached
 * index for — the stats views would show a dangling entry with no title, no
 * counts and no cover.
 *
 * PHASE 1 — `materializeHistoryRows`, local and unmetered. Every volume with
 * genuine reading activity that has no row gets one, resolved by `volume_uuid`
 * against the already-cached `series.json` indexes. Zero network, one write
 * transaction for the whole sweep, and no dependence on the progress record
 * carrying a `series_title` — see that function for why that last part is the
 * whole point.
 *
 * WHAT NEITHER PHASE REACHES. An entry with no `series_title` AND no cached
 * `series.json` for its series falls between them: phase 1 cannot find its
 * uuid in any index, and phase 2 skips it outright below because it has no name
 * to pull by. So "legacy entries are now reachable" holds only once the
 * listing-wide index refresh has cached an index for that series — which for a
 * connected account arrives on its own, and for a series long gone from the
 * cloud never does.
 *
 * PHASE 2 — the network fallback. A series that phase 1 could not serve
 * because this device has NO cached index for it gets its `series.json`
 * pulled and its volumes materialized (`openSeries`), which is exactly the
 * state the series would have been in had the user opened it. Phase 1 runs
 * first so the rows it creates take those series out of phase 2's reckoning.
 * Uncapped, and with no session memory of what it tried: the trigger is one
 * run per progress sync with the index refresh already awaited
 * (`resolveSyncedProgress`), so this phase only ever downloads an index the
 * listing shows but that refresh failed to cache — and a series absent from
 * the cloud costs `openSeries` zero I/O. The old per-mount memo existed to
 * stop a per-mount sweep re-pulling an absent series; it could also poison a
 * series attempted before its index had landed, and it had nothing left to
 * save.
 *
 * Cheap in the normal case: one pass over the progress records, one INDEX-KEY
 * read of the local rows (never a full scan — `volumes` rows carry thumbnail
 * blobs), one over the cached indexes, and zero network when nothing dangles.
 * Tombstones (`deletedOn`) are skipped — the user deleted those on purpose.
 *
 * Returns the series titles actually ATTEMPTED (via `openSeries`) while a
 * provider was connected. `openSeries` resolving without throwing says
 * nothing about network success on its own — a series can genuinely not
 * exist in the cloud, in which case nothing is downloaded but nothing throws
 * either — so this is "attempted", not "confirmed fetched". Never rejects.

 * the reading record, and only the record drives what the stats views show —
 * including `ReadingSpeedView`'s `[Missing Series Info]` bucket and the trash

 * writes reach nothing for the rest of the visit: the bucket keeps every
 * volume the sweep just resolved, and the destructive control keeps offering
 * them. The second enrichment closes exactly that window.
 *
 * The FIRST enrichment is kept because it is the fast path — it needs only rows
 * already on the device, and the page should not wait on a cloud listing to
 * show titles it can resolve immediately. It is also nearly free when there is
 * nothing to do: `enrichAllOrphanedVolumes` reads IndexedDB only when the store
 * actually holds an orphan, and then only those rows.
