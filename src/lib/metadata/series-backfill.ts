/**
 * Converges a `series.json` that has facts (or a partial index) but is
 * missing volume entries for archives the cloud actually holds, WITHOUT the
 * user downloading anything: it pulls just the missing/stale archives'
 * `.mokuro`/`.mokuro.gz` sidecars, builds proper entries from them (uuid +
 * counts measured from the mokuro, title from the archive filename), and
 * publishes through `unifiedCloudManager.writeSeriesFile` — the single writer,
 * same as every other producer of the file.
 *
 * Two entry points, one engine (`runBackfill`):
 *
 * - {@link backfillSeriesEntries} — the ordinary trigger (series open, and the
 *   reconcile pass for every folder that already has a sidecar). Requires a
 *   readable `series.json` to already exist; a bare cloud folder nobody
 *   linked or backed up is never swept.
 * - {@link backfillNewlyLinkedSeries} — the link-event trigger: a facts edit
 *   just made a series.json PUBLISHABLE for a series this device has nothing
 *   local for (`hasPublishableFacts` in `series-file-sync.ts`), and the file
 *   itself may not exist in the cloud yet (its facts-only write is still
 *   debouncing). Skips the existing-file requirement; everything else is
 *   identical, including the gates.
 *
 * Both are re-entrancy-safe per series (`normalizeSeriesKey`) and never throw
 * — failures are logged at debug and swallowed, same contract as every other
 * background metadata pass in this app.
 *
 * Two SEPARATE concurrency budgets keep a reconcile pass over a large
 * half-converged library from becoming the exact "200 concurrent scans + 200
 * concurrent PUTs" stampede `series-file-sync.ts`'s own `WRITE_CONCURRENCY`
 * was written to prevent (see `write-slot.ts`):
 *
 * - `acquireBackfillSlot` (`sidecar-pull.ts`) bounds how many series' worth
 *   of EXPENSIVE work (the indexed `volumesForFoldedSeriesTitle` read, the
 *   sidecar pulls, the write) run at once — shared with the cover service's
 *   render-demand pulls, since fast browsing must not stampede a provider any
 *   more than a reconcile sweep may. A
 *   CONVERGED series never touches this budget at all: the cheap
 *   listing-only candidate check runs first and returns immediately when
 *   there is nothing to do, so a sweep over N already-converged folders
 *   costs N cache reads, not N queued slots.
 * - The final publish additionally acquires `write-slot.ts`'s shared
 *   `acquireWriteSlot`, the SAME pool the debounced fact-edit writer uses —
 *   so a burst of backfill-triggered writes and a burst of ordinary
 *   debounced writes share one PUT budget instead of two independent ones.

/**
 * Heal-by-overwrite: schedule a `series.json` write when the published copy

 * counterpart of the read-side healing that has existed all along
 * (`parseSeriesFile` collapses doubles, `buildSeriesFile`'s winner rules
 * replace 0/0 entries), which produced healed content that nothing ever
 * published.
 *
 * THE RATCHET this closes (user-reported, confirmed against the code paths):
 * cover resolution for a BARE placeholder takes decision-tree case 3
 * (`cover-service.ts`), which measures the volume and schedules a series.json
 * write — but covers are only requested for what a catalog card actually
 * shows (the top volume, or the top few in stack mode). So the FIRST write
 * for a browsed series publishes volume 1 measured and volumes 2..N as 0/0
 * no-metadata entries — and that write is a ratchet: once `series.json`
 * exists, every later placeholder is INDEXED, cover resolution takes case 2
 * (direct sidecar fetch — no measurement, no write), and the 0/0 entries
 * lock themselves in permanently. Installing the volumes did not help either
 * (nothing scheduled a write on install — fixed alongside this, in
 * `download-queue.ts` / `import-service.ts`), and this seam is what repairs
 * the files that ratchet already damaged: the next read cycle that flows
 * through `runBackfill` (series open, or the reconcile sweep) notices the
 * material difference and publishes the healed content once.
 *
 * ONE seam on purpose: every read+build cycle outside the write path already
 * funnels through `runBackfill`, so the difference check exists exactly here
 * — no new whole-listing sweep, no second predicate to drift. The decision
 * costs no network: `existing` is the copy `refreshSeriesIndexForSeries`
 * (stamp-gated) returned moments ago, and `previewSeriesFileBuild` reads only
 * the local tables and the already-fetched listing cache.
 *
 * The LOCAL read cost is NOT a flat handful of reads per folder, though:
 * `previewSeriesFileBuild`, and (when `raw_entry_collapse` is the only
 * candidate term) {@link hasLocalVolumeStanding} below, both go through
 * `volumesForFoldedSeriesTitle`, whose `orderBy('series_title').uniqueKeys()`
 * walks every DISTINCT local series title on each call (see that function's
 * own doc) — index-only, never a row, but not O(1) either. Swept across a
 * whole reconcile pass (`runReconcile` calls this seam once per
 * sidecar-bearing cloud folder) the true shape is O(folders × distinct local
 * series titles) index-only reads, not O(folders). No cheap prefilter was
 * added to cut that down on purpose: every necessary-condition set analyzed
 * while building this seam either missed a material case (rename-shaped
 * collapses, additions) or duplicated the predicate outright — a missed case
 * is a heal lost silently, which is the bug the seam exists to fix. A future
 * optimizer narrowing this should know that ground was already covered, not
 * re-walk it from scratch.
 *
 * Two triggers, both run through the SAME preview this function fetches once
 * — no bypass, no second read path:
 *
 * - {@link seriesFileHealDifference} over (published, preview build): the
 *   material terms — collapse, 0/0 superseded by measured, inherited-field
 *   enrichment, listing-backed addition — and nothing else; see its doc for
 *   why uuid tie flips, value drift, prunes and local-only additions are
 *   deliberately NOT material (each would ping-pong two live devices).
 * - `raw_entry_collapse` on the cached record, checked only when the above
 *   found nothing: the published BYTES still hold doubled entries that
 *   read-time healing collapsed — invisible in any parsed copy, so
 *   `existing` here already looks clean and `seriesFileHealDifference` can
 *   never see it (the parse sites persist the fact separately, see
 *   `SeriesIndexRecord.raw_entry_collapse`). Gated on
 *   {@link hasLocalVolumeStanding}: earlier this fired unconditionally and
 *   was the one MEDIUM bug in the seam's first review — a folder this device
 *   has no local rows for still gets swept every reconcile pass (every
 *   sidecar-bearing cloud folder, not just this device's own, see
 *   `runReconcile`), so an unconditional flag would schedule a write EVERY
 *   pass, `performWrite`'s own publishability gate (`hasBackedUpVolume` /
 *   `hasPublishableFacts` in `series-file-sync.ts`) would drop it every time,
 *   and the flag — true about a file this device cannot fix — would never
 *   clear: scheduled, dropped, rescheduled, forever. Exactly the shape
 *   `locallyKnownSeriesKeys` exists to prevent on the OTHER trigger
 *   (missing-sidecar candidates). A foreign folder now fails the standing
 *   check and never schedules; the flag persists harmlessly on the cached
 *   record until a device WITH standing reads the file and heals it —
 *   converging the same way, because a successful write re-stamps the record
 *   WITHOUT the flag.
 *
 * The write itself goes through `scheduleSeriesFileWrite`: the same 2 s
 * per-series debounce (so this coalesces with install-triggered schedules for
 * the same folder), the same fire-time gates, the same shared write slots —
 * and NO options: no `fromCloudListing` (no listing was fetched to back this
 * schedule — the write pays the ordinary TTL-coalesced refresh, usually free
 * right after the reconcile pass's own fetch), and no `cloudMeasuredVolumes`
 * (the write rebuilds from local rows and the listing's own stamps, so a
 * heal-write can never publish provisional stamps).
 *
 * Callers gate on `hasWritableNonServerProvider()` (runBackfill's first
 * line); the belt here keeps the seam safe if it ever grows another caller —
 * a read-only browser of a shared library, or a server that compiles
 * series.json itself, must never fire heal-writes.
 *
 * Returns whether a write was scheduled (for tests). Never throws.
