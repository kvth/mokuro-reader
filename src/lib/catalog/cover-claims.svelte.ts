/**
 * THE ONE COVER EFFECT. Every surface that draws a cloud cover — the catalog
 * grid card, the catalog list row, the series spine shelf, the volume row, the
 * placeholder box — runs the same three-part rule, and runs it HERE:
 *
 * 1. CLAIM what it draws. A volume with no `thumbnail` of its own and a
 *    listing `cloudPath` has its cover in `cloud_covers`; `cover-resolver.ts`
 *    turns that path into one keyed read and a refcounted handle.
 * 2. ASK for what is missing, but only once the surface is near the viewport
 *    (`cover-viewport.ts`). This is the gate that turns ~4,347 requests on a
 *    1,027-series library into the ~74 a screenful actually needs.
 * 3. RELEASE every handle exactly once, in the order below.
 *
 * It lived in five near-identical copies before this — three single-claim
 * (`PlaceholderThumbnail`, `CatalogListItem`, `VolumeItem`) and two
 * multi-claim (`CatalogItem`, `SeriesSpineShowcase`) — and they had already
 * drifted: only `CatalogItem` had the acquire-then-release ordering below, so
 * the spine shelf still carried the blank-for-a-frame bug that ordering exists
 * to fix. Five copies of one rule is how that happens.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS AT THE CALL SITE: which volumes a surface draws and which it may
 * ask for. Those genuinely differ (a card claims its whole stack but asks only
 * for the slice the stack will draw; a list row's claim path falls back from
 * the stored row to the listing prop), so they are the two getters this takes.
 * Everything downstream of them is here.

   * surface requests NOTHING EVER, and the user gets a permanently blank cover
   * with no error, no failed request, and nothing in the console. There is no
   * type that prevents it — `use:gate` is markup, and a required argument would
   * only move the same silent omission to a forgotten `bind:this`, which fails
