/**
 * THE cover service: every surface that draws a cloud cover — the catalog
 * card, the series spine shelf, the single-volume placeholder box — calls
 * `requestCover(vol)` and nothing else. Delivery happens through the DB:
 * once a cover lands, it is written (via `cover-persist.ts`'s `installCover`)
 * onto whatever row it belongs to, OR — for a volume with no local
 * relationship at all — into the account-scoped `cloud_covers` cache instead
 * (see case 2 below and `cover-persist.ts`'s ROUTING doc). The `volumes`
 * liveQuery → `volumesWithPlaceholders` → catalog re-derive is what every
 * view re-renders from for a rowed volume; `cloud_covers` is read directly by
 * the catalog decoration pass for everything else. There is no per-component
 * result plumbing, and no in-memory cover cache outside this module's own
 * in-flight bookkeeping.
 *
 * User ruling, twice now: "install them and their metadata if they are
 * requested for rendering for a series card" — and, when a rendered volume
 * has no metadata at all yet, "the service fetches what it needs to build
 * it." That ruling covers a volume the user has actually installed or read;
 * it does not license minting a `volumes` row for every volume merely
 * scrolled past in a large cloud catalog (a regression measured at 434 → over
 * 11,000 rows browsing a ~1,000-series library, see `installCover`'s ROUTING
 * doc). `requestCover` first asks the ACCOUNT'S CACHE, then resolves exactly one
 * of four cases per volume:
 *
 * 0. The cover is already in `cloud_covers` for this account (one keyed
 *    read). If the volume is one the user has READ and whose pages are not
 *    here (`coverBelongsOnRow`), the cached blob is PROMOTED onto the row —
 *    handed to `installCover` with the stamp the cache row recorded, no
 *    network — unless that stamp is stale against the listing's current
 *    sidecar, in which case the ladder continues to a fetch. Otherwise the
 *    surface drawing the volume resolves the cache by path itself
 *    (`cover-resolver.ts`) and nothing more is done. This is what lets a
 *    cover fetched while a volume was merely browsed reach the row that
 *    volume earns by being read — the progress tracker draws
 *    `row.thumbnail` and nothing else.
 * 1. A DB row already exists (installed, or metadata-only) → hand the cover
 *    to `installCover` for that row, WITH the listing's cloud path: a
 *    metadata-only row minted by browsing or by a series open has no
 *    relationship yet, so its blob belongs in `cloud_covers` and needs that
 *    path as its key (`installCover`'s ROUTING doc decides which).
 * 2. An INDEX-ADOPTED placeholder (`isIndexedPlaceholder` — a real uuid and
 *    counts already adopted from the cached `series_index`) → fetch the
 *    cover, if the listing has one, and hand it to `installCover` WITHOUT
 *    materializing a row first. Browsing this placeholder never mints a
 *    `volumes` row on its own; `installCover`'s own routing (Task 4) decides
 *    where the cover lands — the `cloud_covers` cache when no row exists, the
 *    row itself if one already does (e.g. a concurrent case-1/3/4 request for
 *    the same uuid materialized it first). A row for this volume is still
 *    created elsewhere, on demand, the moment it graduates to something with
 *    a real local relationship — installed, read, or its series opened
 *    (`materializeSeriesVolumes`, called directly by the series-open flow).
 * 3. A BARE placeholder whose archive HAS a `.mokuro`/`.mokuro.gz` sidecar in
 *    the listing → pull it (the SAME `pullMokuroEntry` a backfill pass uses,
 *    throttled through the SAME cross-series `acquireBackfillSlot` pool —
 *    render-demand browsing must not stampede a provider any more than a
 *    reconcile sweep may), materialize the row under the mokuro's REAL uuid
 *    (batched: see `queueMaterialization` — resolution is per volume, the
 *    WRITE is per burst), install the cover, and hand the FULLY-STAMPED entry
 *    to the per-series
 *    debounced `series.json` writer via `ScheduleOptions.cloudMeasuredVolumes`
 *    — the SAME mechanism `series-backfill.ts`'s own direct publish uses, so
 *    the entry's `mokuro_size`/`mokuro_modified`/cover stamps survive into
 *    the published file rather than falling back to the installed-row fill
 *    path and landing stampless — so the index converges too (best-effort —
 *    its own gates apply at fire time, same as every other producer of that
 *    file).
 * 4. A BARE placeholder whose archive has NO sidecar at all (image-only) →
 *    the same zero-count entry convention `series-backfill.ts` uses for this
 *    case, no pull.
 *
 * This makes the catalog grid a SECOND materialization trigger, alongside a
 * series open: a BARE placeholder (cases 3/4) still materializes the moment
 * its cover is actually rendered, never before. An index-adopted placeholder
 * (case 2) is deliberately NOT a materialization trigger any more — it is the
 * common case for a browsed catalog (a `serverCompilesMetadata` provider or a
 * synced `series.json` supplies it for nearly every volume), so letting it
 * mint a row per rendered card is exactly what produced the regression above.
 * Cases 3/4 stay a per-render ROW because they are inherently rate-limited by
 * the network pull itself (`acquireBackfillSlot`'s pool), not by request
 * volume — but they are no longer a per-render WRITE: their rows are batched
 * (`queueMaterialization`), so a burst of them costs one mutation.
 *
 * READ-ONLY PROVIDERS: pulling a sidecar/cover and materializing a row (cases
 * 3/4) are READS plus a LOCAL write — allowed on a read-only share. Only the
 * `series.json` PUBLISH (case 3) is gated on writability, and that gate
 * already lives inside `scheduleSeriesFileWrite` itself; this module never
 * duplicates it. A `serverCompilesMetadata` provider normally supplies case 2
 * (its own compiled index); a volume it has not compiled yet simply falls
 * through to case 3, whose publish attempt is intercepted/skipped server-side
 * the same way every other client write to that file is.
 *
 * DEDUPE: `requestCover` is idempotent and safe to fire on every re-render.
 * A uuid currently IN FLIGHT shares that request rather than starting a
 * second one, and a uuid that has SETTLED is asked again only when something
 * material changed: the ledger records WHAT was delivered (`'row'`,
 * `'cache'` or `'none'`) and AGAINST WHICH listing stamp, and a request is
 * redundant only when the same stamp already reached a target at least as
 * good as the one this volume needs now — see {@link isRedundant}. That is
 * what lets a cover settled in the cache while the volume was browsed be
 * promoted onto the row the moment the volume is rendered as read, and what
 * lets a changed sidecar be re-fetched by whichever surface notices. This is
 * the ONE ledger for every surface — previously each component kept its own,
 * which is exactly how the same volume could be asked for three times by
 * three different views of it. Both halves are keyed by ACCOUNT SCOPE as
 * well as uuid — see {@link ledgerKey}.
 *
 * Every request resolves to a {@link CoverOutcome}. Surfaces ignore it; the
 * series-open pass and the backfill (`cover-install.ts`,
 * `series-backfill.ts`) await it, which is how "installed" there means
 * landed.

 * `cachePath` is threaded through at EVERY call site, not just the row-less
 * ones: without it a browsed volume's cover has no cache identity and is
 * dropped at flush time, leaving the card permanently blank. `undefined` is
 * only for a caller that genuinely has no cloud path in hand.
 *
 * `mode` is `'overwrite'` exactly when `vol` ALREADY carried a thumbnail at

 *
 * THE RE-DOWNLOAD GUARD. Until covers were cut out of catalog derivation, a

 * stamped the cached blob onto the placeholder, so `isCoverFetchTarget` saw a
 * `thumbnail` and said no. With that decoration gone, every cloud volume reads

 * every reload, trading the freeze for a network storm. Asked at REQUEST time
 * rather than read off the keys-only store: the store fills asynchronously
 * behind the cloud listing, while cards call `requestCover` the moment that
 * same listing renders them — a gate read off it would be empty for the first
 * screenful and let exactly the storm it exists to stop through.
 *
 * NOT A STALENESS CHECK on its own: for a relationship-less volume the
 * answer is "cached, done" whatever the stamp says (a stale cache-resident
 * cover is the backfill's `refresh` request to fix). Only a promotion
 * compares stamps, because only a promotion writes the blob somewhere new.
