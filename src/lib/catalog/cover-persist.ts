/**
 * The coalesced write queue behind `cover-service.ts` — the ONE place that
 * actually touches `db.volumes` for a cloud cover, whoever asked for it.
 * Deliberately its own leaf module rather than folded into `cover-service.ts`
 * itself: `cover-service.ts` imports pull/build helpers from
 * `$lib/metadata/series-backfill.ts` (decision-tree cases 3/4), and THAT
 * module's own `refreshStaleCover` needs this same queue — importing it from
 * `cover-service.ts` instead would create a direct two-file import cycle.
 * This module has no dependency on either, so both can depend on it.
 *
 * User ruling: "install them and their metadata if they are requested for
 * rendering for a series card." Two things happen once a cover fetch lands
 * on a real row (`installCover`):
 *
 * 1. The thumbnail is written behind a transactional guard — re-read the row
 *    inside the write transaction and re-test `needsDownload(...)` against
 *    THAT read, not the snapshot the caller started from — a download finishing
 *    mid-fetch installs the volume with a thumbnail measured from its own
 *    pages, and this must never clobber that. `mode: 'fill'` (the default)
 *    additionally never touches a row that already has ANY thumbnail — the
 *    ordinary "nothing here yet" case. `mode: 'overwrite'` is for a
 *    DELIBERATE stale-cover refresh (the caller already decided the existing
 *    thumbnail is out of date) and skips only the installed-volume guard,
 *    never the thumbnail-presence one. An overwrite also invalidates the
 *    canvas-side `thumbnailCache` for that uuid — the SAME "cover replaced"
 *    invalidation `volume-editor.ts`/`UploadView.svelte` already do for
 *    their own cover-replacing flows — so a card does not keep painting the
 *    stale bitmap it already decoded under this row's uuid.
 * 2. The SOURCE cover sidecar's listing stamp — bytes + epoch-seconds mtime —
 *    is recorded as `cover_size`/`cover_modified` on the row, mirroring
 *    `SeriesFileVolume`'s entry stamps exactly. This is what lets a LATER
 *    pass decide staleness without guessing: absent stamps are never treated
 *    as stale on their own (same migration-safety inversion as the
 *    series-index entry stamps — see `cloud-sidecar-stamps.ts`), so a
 *    thumbnail installed by older code, or measured from the volume's own
 *    pages, is left alone forever rather than being "healed" by a pull.
 *
 * ROUTING (`coverBelongsOnRow`): a cover for a metadata-only `volumes` row
 * the user has read lands on that row exactly as described above. A cover for a volume with NO row — pure catalog
 * knowledge, nothing the user has installed or read — is catalog knowledge
 * only, and lands in `cloud_covers` instead (Task 2's blob-only cache table),
 * keyed by the ACTIVE account's scope so two accounts never blend covers.
 * When no account is active the flush has nowhere safe to attribute an
 * unrowed cover to, so it is simply dropped — never written unscoped. Either
 * way this module never creates a `volumes` row itself; that is still
 * `cover-service.ts`'s job (decision-tree cases 1-4), done BEFORE a cover
 * ever reaches this queue.
 *
 * IMMEDIACY, AND WHAT LITTLE BATCHING REMAINS. There used to be a fixed
 * 750ms debounce here (and before that, one that WIDENED to 8s under
 * pressure). Both were bandaids for a disease that is cured: back then every
 * `cloud_covers` commit re-derived the whole catalog, so fewer commits meant
 * fewer freezes. Covers are OUT of `volumesWithPlaceholders` entirely now, a
 * cover commit reaches exactly the cards holding its paths (`cover-resolver`
 * + the keys-only watch), and the provider-cache emissions are coalesced on
 * their own — so the debounce had stopped buying anything and was only
 * DELAYING paint: download → queue → [750ms] → commit → handle → pixel.
 * User ruling: "The user wants to see asap, and the only remedy for ui jank
 * is to background the downloads, not to pace them."
 *
 * So a queued cover now drains on the NEXT MICROTASK — no fixed wait of any
 * length. The only grouping left is the grouping that costs zero latency:
 *
 * - arrivals in the same synchronous burst (one tick) share one flush,
 *   because the microtask fires after the burst;
 * - arrivals while a flush transaction is in flight ride the NEXT flush —
 *   at most ONE flush transaction is ever open, and the running drain loops
 *   until the queue is empty, so a sustained burst drains back-to-back and
 *   IndexedDB's own write latency is what sizes the batches;
 * - a batch never carries more than `COVER_PERSIST_MAX_BATCH` covers, so a
 *   backlog that piled up behind a slow commit still flushes in bounded
 *   transactions rather than one enormous one;
 * - the queue itself is bounded by `COVER_PERSIST_MAX_PENDING`. See that
 *   constant for what happens when it is exceeded.
 *
 * Scheduling only ever changes WHEN a cover lands, never WHETHER it does:
 * every queued cover still lands, with two documented exceptions — an app
 * close between install and the (now at-most-milliseconds-later) flush, and
 * a queue overflow (below).
 */

/**
 * Hard ceiling on how many covers ONE flush transaction may carry.
 *
 * With the debounce gone this is no longer what closes an ordinary batch —
 * natural co-arrival is (see the module doc) — but it still bounds the
 * transaction a BACKLOG produces: covers that piled up behind a slow commit,
 * or a forced drain of a deep queue, flush in slices of at most this many.
 * At the measured mean cover size of ~31.6KB (134MB / 4,347 covers on the
 * reference library) that bounds a single transaction at ~3.2MB — against
 * ~66MB for the worst batch the old widening debounce produced. What a
 * commit costs (the structured clone of the batch, the transaction itself,
 * one keys-only liveQuery re-run) is roughly linear in batch size, while the
 * main-thread stall a commit can cause is not: one 66MB clone is a
 * multi-frame freeze that no amount of "fewer commits" makes up for.

/**
 * Hard ceiling on the QUEUE — how many fetched covers may sit un-flushed at
 * once. Roughly 10 batches, i.e. ~32MB of `File` objects retained at the
 * measured mean cover size.
 *
 * OVERFLOW POLICY, stated explicitly because the queue used to be an
 * unbounded `Map`: when a new cover arrives at a full queue, the OLDEST
 * queued cover is DROPPED to make room. Rationale:
 *
 * - drains start a microtask behind the first arrival, so a queue this deep
 *   means either arrivals outran IndexedDB for ~10 consecutive transactions
 *   or one synchronous burst queued a thousand covers in a single tick.
 *   Without a bound the queue would retain every fetched blob until the
 *   backlog cleared — 134MB on the reference library's cold start;
 * - the newest arrivals are kept because cover requests are viewport-gated
 *   (`CatalogItem`'s `IntersectionObserver`), so the newest request is the
 *   one most likely to be for a card the user is looking at NOW;
 * - a dropped cover is not lost user data. It is a cache fill: the card shows
 *   its placeholder, and the cover is re-fetched the next time that series is
 *   in view in a fresh session (`cover-service.ts`'s `settled` bookkeeping is
 *   in-memory only, so it does not outlive a reload).
 *
 * Deliberately set high enough that no measured workload reaches it — this is
 * a safety valve against a pathological runaway, not part of the normal path.
