 * One cloud volume's thumbnail, cached because the user browsed past it.

 * Deliberately narrow: everything else a cloud card needs — title, counts,
 * archive size, the cover sidecar's own size/modified stamps — already lives
 * in the cached `series_index` row for that series. Duplicating those fields
 * here would just be a second invalidation path to get wrong. This table
 * exists only for the one thing nothing else holds: the blob.
 *
 * NOT a `volumes` row: nothing here is a relationship with the volume, it is
 * catalog knowledge that may be discarded at any time (see
 * `pruneExpiredCloudCovers`). A volume the user installs or reads graduates
 * to a real `volumes` row and its cover entry becomes redundant.
 *
 * PK is `[account_scope+path]` because providers do not expose volume uuids
 * for files the client has not opened, and the same path under a different
 * account is a different file.

   * Epoch ms when this cover was fetched and written. Drives expiry only —
   * see `pruneExpiredCloudCovers`. Normally set once, at flush
   * (`cover-persist.ts`), and never TOUCHED afterward just because something
   * read the row — see below for why. It is not write-ONCE, though: a
   * `metadata_only` row's stale cover self-heals back through this same
   * table (`putCloudCovers` is a `bulkPut`; see `cover-resolver.ts`'s `NO
   * force` paragraph for when that fires), which is a genuine second write
   * with a fresh `cached_at`, at the same `[account_scope+path]` key. That
   * overwrite changes no KEY, so nothing downstream that watches the key set
   * for arrivals (`cachedCoverPathSet`'s liveQuery) ever notices it — it is
   * invisible to that diff, not forbidden from happening.
   *
   * NOT BECAUSE NOTHING READS THE ROW. That used to be the reason, and it is
   * no longer true in either half: a cached cover's blob was stamped onto its
   * placeholder, so `isCoverFetchTarget` saw a `thumbnail` and never asked
   * again, and nothing else looked at the row at all. That decoration is gone
   * — it is what turned one cover landing into a whole-catalog re-derive — and
   * this row is now read constantly. `isCachedCoverPath` (`cover-service.ts`)
   * exists precisely because the fetch gate lost its accidental suppressor,
   * and `cover-resolver.ts` reads the row on EVERY claim.
   *
   * IT IS NOT REFRESHED, AND THE REASON IS NOT A FEEDBACK LOOP. An earlier
   * version of this comment claimed a touch would re-fire
   * `cachedCoverPathSet`, drive `refreshCoverKeys`, re-read held handles and
   * touch again. That loop does not exist: a touch changes only `cached_at`,
   * the KEY set is unchanged, and the store dedupes on the key set before
   * publishing — so nothing is published and nothing re-reads.
   *
   * The real cost is per-touch, not runaway. Every commit re-runs that
   * liveQuery's querier (a keys-only scan of the whole table) and broadcasts
   * `storagemutated` — a per-commit cost the ingest path pays deliberately
   * (immediacy over pacing, see `cover-persist.ts`) and that nothing should
   * add to gratuitously. A touch per claim would put one of each behind
   * ordinary scrolling, which is reason enough. So there is deliberately no `touchCloudCovers` — see
   * `CLOUD_COVER_MAX_AGE_MS`.
   *
   * THE PRICE, STATED PLAINLY: `CLOUD_COVER_MAX_AGE_MS` is "14 days after
   * caching", not "14 days since last viewed", so a cover the user looks at
   * every day is still discarded on schedule. What that costs is one re-fetch
   * the next time something asks for it — `isCachedCoverPath` answers false
   * once the row is gone, and the fetch pipeline caches it again exactly as it
   * did the first time. A cache miss, not a defect.
   *
   * Staleness of the cover ITSELF is decided elsewhere, by comparing
   * `series_index`'s `cover_size`/`cover_modified` for this volume against the
   * current listing; nothing stored on this row participates in that
   * comparison.
