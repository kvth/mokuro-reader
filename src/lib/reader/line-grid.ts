/**
 * The line as a rotated box with its characters on a uniform grid — the
 * placement model the Android reader Chimahon uses, which our own bench found
 * as good as any per-character data (documentation/superpowers/specs/
 * 2026-09-19-ocr-engine-options-findings.md: print pitch varies ~1.5%, a
 * uniform grid is 0.047 pitch off the ink on average).
 *
 * A line is a centre, a main extent (along the writing direction), a cross
 * extent and an angle. Its characters sit one per step of the line's PITCH,
 * each glyph centred in its step, all in the line's own rotated frame.
 *
 * The pitch is NOT `main / count`: a detector's quad hugs the ink, and the
 * first and last glyphs leave part of their cells empty (`glyph-insets.ts`),
 * so the quad covers fewer than `count` cells and the first cell starts before
 * the quad does. And the columns of one block are typeset at ONE pitch, so a
 * block's lines share theirs (`linePitches`) — a short line's own estimate is
 * the worst one available.
 *
 * The reader draws that WITHOUT a span per character: the line stays one text
 * node (the lightest DOM, and the one extensions such as Yomitan and Migaku
 * are safest with) and the grid is CSS `letter-spacing`; the rotation is a CSS
 * transform, which leaves the span in normal flow (issue #254) and takes the
 * browser's own hit-testing — what a pop-up dictionary scans with — along.
 *
 * Pure geometry, no DOM.
