/**
 * Per-line layout of a text block, derived from the `lines_coords`
 * quadrilaterals that mokuro emits for every OCR line. It places the lines of
 * the reader's `auto` font mode (sizes fitted to the quads) and of its
 * `original` one (`size: 'file'` — the file's own `font_size`, capped by the
 * same quads).
 *
 * mokuro's block-level `font_size` is the mean detected line-quad width, which
 * for vertical Japanese includes furigana and mask slack — median 1.2x (p95 2x)
 * larger than the true character size — so rendering `font_size`px overflows
 * the block box. The quads themselves are reliable: each line's quad gives its
 * exact position and extent, and its pitch (`line-grid.ts`) recovers the true
 * per-line font size. See documentation/superpowers/specs/
 * 2026-07-04-original-mode-line-coords-design.md (written when only the mode
 * now called `auto` existed, under the name "original").
 *
 * Characters sit on a FIXED-PITCH GRID along the line (`line-grid.ts`): the
 * pitch comes from the quad corrected for the ink the first and last glyphs do
 * not have (`glyph-insets.ts`) and is shared by the lines of a block; the run
 * is letter-spaced to that pitch from the line's start, and a line whose quad
 * is tilted renders rotated, in its own frame. See documentation/superpowers/specs/
 * 2026-09-19-ocr-engine-options-findings.md.
