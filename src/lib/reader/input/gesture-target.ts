/**
 * Gesture target classification — THE statement of the reader's
 * element-routing contracts. Every input handler classifies its event target
 * through here instead of scattering `closest('.textBox')` calls.
 *
 * # The contracts
 *
 * **`.textBox` (role 'textbox') is an input-routing protocol, not styling.**
 * OCR text boxes own their gestures: double-tap is the AnkiConnect
 * card-capture gesture (TextBoxes.svelte's own dblclick handler — which also
 * stopPropagation()s as defense in depth), mouse/pen drags are text
 * selection (Yomitan/Migaku scanning), and the custom context menu lives
 * there. Reader surfaces must never start a pan from a mouse/pen press on a
 * text box, never treat clicks on one as overlay toggles, and never zoom on
 * its double-taps. Single-finger TOUCH is the exception: touch has no
 * drag-selection gesture, so touch pans across text boxes (as the old
 * panzoom touch path always did).
 *
 * **`.editBlock` (role 'editor')** is the OCR edit overlay
 * (`EditOverlay.svelte`). The overlay `setPointerCapture`s its own pointers
 * and lets the events BUBBLE: the surface's tracker adds them to its pointer
 * map like any other press, but must never pan, tap-toggle, or zoom from role
 * 'editor', for ANY pointer type (unlike text boxes, where touch still pans).
 * Bubbling is what keeps "pinch always wins" true here: a second pointer
 * makes two in the map, the surface pinches, and the editor's drag or draw
 * YIELDS — it cancels and rolls back whatever it had moved.
 *
 * The overlay's own background is 'page' (pan / tap / pinch while editing)
 * except while the draw-box tool is armed, when the overlay marks its root
 * `[data-edit-draw]`: the next background drag is the editor's, so the
 * surface must not pan under it or take the pointer capture from it.
 *
 * **'interactive'** is reader chrome (buttons, links): taps belong to the
 * control, not to overlay toggling or zoom.
 *
 * **'page'** is everything else — pannable, zoomable, tappable surface.
 *
 * The classification walks ancestors (`closest`), so extension-injected
 * wrappers inside a text box (Yomitan spans, Migaku rubies) classify as the
 * text box they live in.
